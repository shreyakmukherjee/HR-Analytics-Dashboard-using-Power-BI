# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

📝 Project Description:
This project focuses on creating an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize employee attrition trends within an organization. The dashboard provides department-wise insights into attrition based on key factors such as job roles, education, salary slabs, overtime, and years at the company. Using real-world HR data, the dashboard helps HR professionals identify problem areas, such as roles with the highest turnover, the impact of overtime, and which salary brackets are most affected. The project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can support data-driven decisions in human resource management.
